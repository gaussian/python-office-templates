"""
Core templating functions.

This module defines process_text() which resolves template tags (delimited by {{ and }})
using the provided context. Both "normal" and "table" modes are supported. In 
"normal" mode, all tags are replaced inline (with list results joined by a delimiter).
In "table" mode, if the text contains exactly one tag, its resolved value is used
to produce the final output (if a list then a list of outputs is returned).
Permission checking is enforced via enforce_permissions().

    Process text containing template tags.

    This implementation searches for all tags via re.finditer and rebuilds the text.

    In "normal" mode, every tag is replaced inlineâ€”if a resolved tag is a list,
    its items are joined with the specified delimiter.

    In "table" mode, the text must contain exactly one tag. If the resolved value is a list,
    a list of strings is returned, where each string is the original text with that tag replaced
    by one of the list items. Otherwise, the tag is replaced inline.
